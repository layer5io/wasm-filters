# WebAssembly Filters for Envoy

This repository meant to house WASM filters written in C,C++,C# and Rust for exercising different features provided by envoy-wasm.

See the [Image Hub](https://layer5.io/projects/image-hub) as a related project (a sample application). Also, see Meshery's filter management capabitilies.

## Get the Rust toolchain

To compile Rust filters to WASM, the nightly toolchain and support for wasm compilation target is needed.
Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed [using Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
If you're on a *nix system (Unix, Linux, MacOS), in the project root directory, run:
```bash
make rust-toolchain
```
This will also install wasm-pack for you.
Also, take a look at [installing wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) for OS other than *nix.

## Upstream

Upstream is a webserver which is used by few of the filters mentioned above. It provides a route for :

* Mock authentication
* Storing Metrics
* Retrieving Metrics

> Build the docker Image for Upstream before proceeding with the examples.

Build Image:
```bash
cd upstream
make
```

## HTTP-Auth

Simulates handling authentication of requests at proxy level. Requests with a header `token` with value `hello` are accepted as authorized while the rest unauthorized. The actual authentication is handled by the Upstream server. Whenever the proxy recieves a request it extracts the `token` header and makes a request to the Upstream server which validates the token and returns a response.

Build and deploy:
```bash
cd http-auth
make run-filtered
```

Test:
```bash
curl  -H "token":"hello" 0.0.0.0:18000 -v # Authorized
curl  -H "token":"world" 0.0.0.0:18000 -v # Unauthorized
```

## TCP-Metrics

Collects simple metrics for every TCP packet and logs it.

Build and deploy:
```bash
cd tcp-metrics
make run-filtered
```

Test:
```bash
curl 0.0.0.0:18000 -v -d "request body"
```

Check the logs for the metrics.

## TCP-Packet-Parse

Parses the contents of every TCP packet the proxy receives and logs it.

Build and deploy:
```bash
cd tcp-packet-parse
make run-filtered
```

Test:
```bash
curl 0.0.0.0:18000 -v -d "request body"
```

Check the logs for the packet contents.

## Singleton-HTTP-Call

An example which depicts an singleton HTTP WASM service which does an HTTP call once every 2 seconds.

Build and deploy:
```bash
cd singleton-http-call
make run-filtered
```

Check the logs for the response of the request.

## Metrics-Store

This example showcases communication between a WASM filter and a service via shared queue. It combines the `Singleton-HTTP-Call` and `TCP-Metrics` examples. The filter collects metrics and enqueues it onto the queue while the service dequeues it and sends it to upstream server where it is stored.

Build and deploy:
```bash
cd metrics-store
make run-filtered
```

Test:
```bash
curl 0.0.0.0:18000 -v -d "request body" # make a few of these calls
curl 0.0.0.0:8080/retrieve -v # Retrieves the stored stats
# x | y | z  === x : downstream bytes, y : upstream bytes, z: the latency for application server to respond 
```
